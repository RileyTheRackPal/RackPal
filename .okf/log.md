# Update Log

## 2026-07-31

* **Update**: [DR-011](/decisions/dr-011-connect-gesture.md) — clauses .1 to .6
  are BUILT (M2-F phases 1B, 2A and 2B). **The connection is made from the
  keyboard, and that is the whole of the ruling's "order that matters"**: the
  pointer path is Phase 3 and has not been written yet. Three findings came out
  of building it, and none was visible from the ruling:
  * **the defect Phase 1A tracked was described backwards.** "A widget
    unmounted mid-press never delivers its terminal and the claim leaks" — in
    fact `GestureBinding` caches the hit test at pointer-DOWN and keeps
    dispatching down the cached path, so the gesture did not stall, it
    COMMITTED out of a widget that had left the tree. Measured: `[begin,
    update]` at the unmount, `[begin, update, update, commit]` at the release.
    The leaked claim was never seen because the stale commit released it;
  * **DR-011.4's first implementation silently did nothing.**
    `ConnectPortsCommand.touches` is `wires | meta`, and the meta bump advanced
    the scene epoch past the stamp the wires listener had just written. Every
    symbol still moved, on the very commit the clause is about;
  * **`unbuilt_copy_accuracy_test.dart` had drifted into a hole shaped like
    this change.** Its scan named `AddLinkCommand` alone, so a schematic wiring
    through `ConnectPortsCommand` would have left it green while the sheet's own
    copy told the user nothing could create a cable. See
    [diagnose before fixing](/practices/diagnose-before-fixing.md) — all three
    are the same shape: a mechanism that reads as working because of what it
    was checked against.
* **Creation**: `kUnstatedMedia` records that **no document can say what cable a
  connect makes**. `Registries.mediaTypes` is empty in every seeded document,
  `SignalFamilyDef` carries no `typicalMedia`, and a `PortDef` names a connector
  rather than a cable — so the alternatives are all fabrications, and
  `ProjectSettings.defaultNetworkMedia` on an HDMI run would put a wrong spec on
  the sheet an installer buys from. [G4](/invariants/g4-unknowns-are-counted.md),
  in the one place it is expensive.

## 2026-07-29

* **Creation**: [DR-011 — the connect gesture](/decisions/dr-011-connect-gesture.md),
  seven clauses scoping M2-F. Three findings forced it, and all three were
  invisible from the API's own surface: NOTHING IN THE APP EVER MATERIALISES A
  PORT (so the connect API shipped in M2-A returns a zero-conductor plan on the
  document the exit criterion starts from), committing a link re-runs the
  auto-layout and moves every symbol, and every link would have landed in the
  Structure domain.
* **Creation**: [One keymap registry](/practices/one-keymap-registry.md) —
  M2-H's practice, INCLUDING THE HALF THAT WAS DONE WRONG. The ban is enforced
  by a test that reads one named file; the package where most remaining UI work
  lands has no layering test at all. A structural rule needs a structural gate.
* **Update**: [DR-009](/decisions/dr-009-macos-in-v1.md)'s register revised —
  two of its rows overstated the debt. `pdfium` is in no pubspec at all, and the
  cross-platform PDF worry cited CR-117, which governs the `.rackmate` JSON and
  not the PDF. Recorded because a register row that has stopped describing the
  tree is worse than a missing one: it is trusted.

## 2026-07-28

* **Update**: Caught the bundle up with M2-D (`e13fa68`) and M2-E (`219c0bf`),
  which had landed after it was written. Batching that catch-up was itself the
  drift this bundle exists to prevent — maintain as changes land, not after.
* **Creation**: [CR-078 — four encoding channels](/invariants/four-encoding-channels.md),
  recording that the GLYPH CHANNEL CURRENTLY CARRIES NOTHING: there is no `tier`
  field, so `glyphAlt` is unreachable for all eight domains and all 55 families.
* **Creation**: [Diagnose before fixing](/practices/diagnose-before-fixing.md) —
  the salvage post-mortem, where twelve consecutive fix commits touched neither
  cause because a third defect made the surface unable to change at all.
* **Update**: [DR-001](/decisions/dr-001-net-labels-by-default.md) is now BUILT,
  with the measured cost against M2-C's baseline: 4155 -> 6555 ops, the label
  layer 19% of a frame with ~4x headroom.
* **Update**: [Package layering](/invariants/package-layering.md) records a
  violation in waiting — `wire_trace.dart` sits in `rackmate_ui`, which
  `rackmate_export` may never import, so the exporter cannot draw a wire and
  M6's interconnect sheets are unbuildable until it moves.
* **Creation**: Scaffolded the RackMate bundle with `okf_init.py`.
* **Creation**: Established the bundle's spine — the ruling to spec to
  implementation to test chain — in [getting started](/getting-started.md).
* **Creation**: `decisions/` with [DR-001](/decisions/dr-001-net-labels-by-default.md),
  [DR-008](/decisions/dr-008-wiring-model.md),
  [DR-009](/decisions/dr-009-macos-in-v1.md) and
  [DR-010](/decisions/dr-010-seeded-registries.md). DR-002 through DR-007 are
  recorded in the canon but not yet written up here.
* **Creation**: `invariants/` with [CR-117](/invariants/cr-117-byte-exactness.md),
  [G4](/invariants/g4-unknowns-are-counted.md) and
  [package layering](/invariants/package-layering.md).
* **Creation**: `gates/` with the [analyzer ratchet](/gates/analyzer-baseline.md),
  [registry parity](/gates/registry-parity.md) and the
  [byte-exactness sweep](/gates/byte-exactness-sweep.md) — each recording its
  blind spot as well as its coverage.
* **Creation**: `practices/` with
  [decompose before building](/practices/decompose-before-building.md), written up
  because a session died mid-milestone and the task breakdown is what made the
  work recoverable.
