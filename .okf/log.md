# Update Log

## 2026-08-01

* **Note**: **M2's criterion is MET.** The user performed the sixty-connection
  drill on 2026-08-01 — roughly 5–7 minutes, after a bit of practice — which
  discharges the last of its five exit clauses. The clause carries no time
  bound, so that figure is a data point rather than a threshold met. **It was
  done without multi-draw**, which is still unbuilt: the gesture is a
  throughput improvement on a clause that is already met, not a requirement of
  it. `CONFIRMED` is not a gate — nothing re-runs a drill, and the gesture
  tests are what guard the mechanism between runs.
* **Note**: M2-G — the paint half of M2's budget was **never measured**, and
  measuring it found the 300-link fixture taking **63.9 ms to replay against a
  16.7 ms frame**, beside a scene build of ~3 ms that a green test had been
  citing. `FlutterDiagramCanvas.drawText` built a fresh `TextPainter` — and a
  native `ui.Paragraph` — on every call, and a pan re-records the picture, so
  2 374 runs were laid out per frame over a working set of 703. With the cache
  the same replay is **10.6 ms**.
* **Note**: the roadmap's sizing for that cache did not survive either. docs/09
  says it "must be sized for" ~10,000 runs and warns a 2,000-entry LRU would
  thrash; the measured working set is **703**. Worse, its prescribed key
  `(text, styleId, quantisedScale)` would have CAUSED the thrash it feared —
  `sizePt` is in diagram units and the zoom is applied to the canvas, so the
  same run lays out identically at every zoom and scale is not a term.
* **Note**: docs/12 §5.1's clause-4 row is corrected in place rather than
  rewritten. It was marked `DEMONSTRATED` on a citation that measured the
  display list being BUILT — `rackmate_core` is pure Dart and cannot touch a
  `ui.Canvas` — which is the exact failure shape that board's opening table
  collects: an assertion that quietly stopped covering the thing it named.
* **Creation**: [DR-013 — deleting a wired device cascades](/decisions/dr-013-delete-cascades.md).
  The `TODO(post-M0)` in `RemoveDeviceCommand` was **inert for every milestone
  up to M2-F** — nothing wrote `doc.ports`, so there was nothing to orphan —
  and DR-011.1 made it live in the same commit that fixed the finding it came
  from. The recommended option (demote the far end to `OpenEndpoint`, which
  AC-018 models as first-class) was **rejected**: a cable to a device that has
  been deleted is not a design intent, it is debris, and M5's validation is not
  there to flag it.
* **Update**: [DR-011](/decisions/dr-011-connect-gesture.md) is **BUILT** — all
  seven clauses, across M2-F's six phases. Two of its findings had SURVIVED the
  phase that was supposed to close them: `AtomicConnectCommand` still never
  materialised a port (Phase 0 had added a guard against the symptom whose own
  comment described the disease), and §11.11.4's layout hold silently did
  nothing because `touches` is `wires | meta` and the meta bump advanced the
  scene epoch past the stamp the wires listener had just written.
* **Update**: [DR-012](/decisions/dr-012-deferred-gesture-rules.md) is **BUILT**
  for three of its four clauses. §11.12.2's multi-draw is deferred to its own
  board item — the ranking is ruled and waiting, which was the part worth
  having.
* **Creation**: [A deferred action needs a frame](/practices/defer-past-the-gesture.md)
  — two defects one phase apart, both invisible to every unit test at both ends:
  `addPostFrameCallback` queues a callback but does not schedule the frame that
  runs it, and a `TabBarView` settles its page under a tab switch made inside
  the click that asked for it.
* **Note**: CR-105's elevation signposting and AC-048's coach mark shipped with
  M2-F Phase 5. The chip is SCREEN CHROME and not scene: `buildRackScene` feeds
  the PDF as well as the screen (CR-086), so a chip emitted into the scene would
  print on the customer's elevation sheet.
* **Note**: `docs/12-milestone-board.md` §5.1 re-audited at `ea0af6d`. M2 moves
  from `NOT STARTED` to **PARTIAL**, four of five exit clauses cited; the open
  one is the sixty-connection drill, which needs a person. Every other row on
  that board is still as of `0fa532d` and says so.

## 2026-07-31

* **Creation**: [DR-012 — the four gesture rules DR-011.8 deferred](/decisions/dr-012-deferred-gesture-rules.md),
  taken before Phase 4 started rather than during it. **Three of the four were
  decided by one piece of arithmetic**: `acceptedFamilies`, `channelIndex` and
  `maxConnections` are all declared on `PortDef`, all round-trip, and all are
  populated on NONE of the 727 seed catalog ports — so every rule that would
  have read them does nothing on every real document. That is the third time
  this shape has appeared in M2-F (see
  [diagnose before fixing](/practices/diagnose-before-fixing.md)); the first
  was `effectiveMaxConnections` in Phase 0.
* **Update**: [DR-011](/decisions/dr-011-connect-gesture.md) §11.8's four open
  questions now point at DR-012. The sharpest of them was chain-draw's
  *"matching output"*, which docs/05's OWN worked example refutes: it chains
  `MTX-1 IN1` to `MTX-1 OUT1`, and **a matrix switcher has no pairing between
  them — that is what makes it a matrix.**
* **Note**: a licensing sweep found the dependency tree clean for a possible
  GPLv3 release — 81 packages, 58 BSD / 18 MIT / 5 Apache-2.0, zero copyleft;
  Jost ships its OFL-1.1 text; the seed catalog is all `Generic` archetypes so
  there is no third-party SKU data. `pdf` being Apache-2.0 means GPLv2 is
  closed and GPLv3 is the only copyleft option. Recorded here because a future
  dependency choice can quietly foreclose it. Not a ruling: the business model
  is §10.3's open question and would need one.
* **Update**: [DR-011](/decisions/dr-011-connect-gesture.md) — clauses .1 to .6
  are BUILT (M2-F phases 1B, 2A and 2B). **The connection is made from the
  keyboard, and that is the whole of the ruling's "order that matters"**: the
  pointer path is Phase 3 and has not been written yet. Three findings came out
  of building it, and none was visible from the ruling:
  * **the defect Phase 1A tracked was described backwards.** "A widget
    unmounted mid-press never delivers its terminal and the claim leaks" — in
    fact `GestureBinding` caches the hit test at pointer-DOWN and keeps
    dispatching down the cached path, so the gesture did not stall, it
    COMMITTED out of a widget that had left the tree. Measured: `[begin,
    update]` at the unmount, `[begin, update, update, commit]` at the release.
    The leaked claim was never seen because the stale commit released it;
  * **DR-011.4's first implementation silently did nothing.**
    `ConnectPortsCommand.touches` is `wires | meta`, and the meta bump advanced
    the scene epoch past the stamp the wires listener had just written. Every
    symbol still moved, on the very commit the clause is about;
  * **`unbuilt_copy_accuracy_test.dart` had drifted into a hole shaped like
    this change.** Its scan named `AddLinkCommand` alone, so a schematic wiring
    through `ConnectPortsCommand` would have left it green while the sheet's own
    copy told the user nothing could create a cable. See
    [diagnose before fixing](/practices/diagnose-before-fixing.md) — all three
    are the same shape: a mechanism that reads as working because of what it
    was checked against.
* **Creation**: `kUnstatedMedia` records that **no document can say what cable a
  connect makes**. `Registries.mediaTypes` is empty in every seeded document,
  `SignalFamilyDef` carries no `typicalMedia`, and a `PortDef` names a connector
  rather than a cable — so the alternatives are all fabrications, and
  `ProjectSettings.defaultNetworkMedia` on an HDMI run would put a wrong spec on
  the sheet an installer buys from. [G4](/invariants/g4-unknowns-are-counted.md),
  in the one place it is expensive.

## 2026-07-29

* **Creation**: [DR-011 — the connect gesture](/decisions/dr-011-connect-gesture.md),
  seven clauses scoping M2-F. Three findings forced it, and all three were
  invisible from the API's own surface: NOTHING IN THE APP EVER MATERIALISES A
  PORT (so the connect API shipped in M2-A returns a zero-conductor plan on the
  document the exit criterion starts from), committing a link re-runs the
  auto-layout and moves every symbol, and every link would have landed in the
  Structure domain.
* **Creation**: [One keymap registry](/practices/one-keymap-registry.md) —
  M2-H's practice, INCLUDING THE HALF THAT WAS DONE WRONG. The ban is enforced
  by a test that reads one named file; the package where most remaining UI work
  lands has no layering test at all. A structural rule needs a structural gate.
* **Update**: [DR-009](/decisions/dr-009-macos-in-v1.md)'s register revised —
  two of its rows overstated the debt. `pdfium` is in no pubspec at all, and the
  cross-platform PDF worry cited CR-117, which governs the `.rackmate` JSON and
  not the PDF. Recorded because a register row that has stopped describing the
  tree is worse than a missing one: it is trusted.

## 2026-07-28

* **Update**: Caught the bundle up with M2-D (`e13fa68`) and M2-E (`219c0bf`),
  which had landed after it was written. Batching that catch-up was itself the
  drift this bundle exists to prevent — maintain as changes land, not after.
* **Creation**: [CR-078 — four encoding channels](/invariants/four-encoding-channels.md),
  recording that the GLYPH CHANNEL CURRENTLY CARRIES NOTHING: there is no `tier`
  field, so `glyphAlt` is unreachable for all eight domains and all 55 families.
* **Creation**: [Diagnose before fixing](/practices/diagnose-before-fixing.md) —
  the salvage post-mortem, where twelve consecutive fix commits touched neither
  cause because a third defect made the surface unable to change at all.
* **Update**: [DR-001](/decisions/dr-001-net-labels-by-default.md) is now BUILT,
  with the measured cost against M2-C's baseline: 4155 -> 6555 ops, the label
  layer 19% of a frame with ~4x headroom.
* **Update**: [Package layering](/invariants/package-layering.md) records a
  violation in waiting — `wire_trace.dart` sits in `rackmate_ui`, which
  `rackmate_export` may never import, so the exporter cannot draw a wire and
  M6's interconnect sheets are unbuildable until it moves.
* **Creation**: Scaffolded the RackMate bundle with `okf_init.py`.
* **Creation**: Established the bundle's spine — the ruling to spec to
  implementation to test chain — in [getting started](/getting-started.md).
* **Creation**: `decisions/` with [DR-001](/decisions/dr-001-net-labels-by-default.md),
  [DR-008](/decisions/dr-008-wiring-model.md),
  [DR-009](/decisions/dr-009-macos-in-v1.md) and
  [DR-010](/decisions/dr-010-seeded-registries.md). DR-002 through DR-007 are
  recorded in the canon but not yet written up here.
* **Creation**: `invariants/` with [CR-117](/invariants/cr-117-byte-exactness.md),
  [G4](/invariants/g4-unknowns-are-counted.md) and
  [package layering](/invariants/package-layering.md).
* **Creation**: `gates/` with the [analyzer ratchet](/gates/analyzer-baseline.md),
  [registry parity](/gates/registry-parity.md) and the
  [byte-exactness sweep](/gates/byte-exactness-sweep.md) — each recording its
  blind spot as well as its coverage.
* **Creation**: `practices/` with
  [decompose before building](/practices/decompose-before-building.md), written up
  because a session died mid-milestone and the task breakdown is what made the
  work recoverable.
